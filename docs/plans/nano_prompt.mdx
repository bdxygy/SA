# Nano Banana Prompts (Catalog & How They Work)

This document extracts the **prompt blocks** from `_docs/nano_banana.md` and explains **how each prompt works** (what it is trying to achieve, expected inputs, constraints, and why the wording matters).

> Note: `_docs/nano_banana.md` does not literally use an `Objective` heading. The closest structure is the **strategy headings** (e.g. `#### 1. Photorealistic scenes`) plus the `### Template` / `### Prompt` blocks. In this doc, each section includes an explicit **Objective** derived from that structure.

## 1) Photorealistic scenes

### Objective
Generate a realistic, photographic image by specifying subject + setting + lighting + camera/lens + mood.

### Prompt
```text
Using the provided image as the subject reference, create a photorealistic
close-up portrait of an elderly Japanese ceramicist with deep, sun-etched
wrinkles and a warm, knowing smile. He is carefully inspecting a freshly
glazed tea bowl. The setting is his rustic, sun-drenched workshop. The scene
is illuminated by soft, golden hour light streaming through a window,
highlighting the fine texture of the clay. Captured with an 85mm portrait
lens, resulting in a soft, blurred background (bokeh). The overall mood is
serene and masterful. Vertical portrait orientation.
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image.
- **Key controls**
  - Composition: *close-up portrait*.
  - Authenticity cues: wrinkles, workshop details, glazing.
  - Lighting: golden hour + directional window light.
  - Optics: *85mm portrait lens* + explicit *bokeh*.
- **Expected output**
  - A coherent photorealistic portrait with cinematic depth-of-field.

## 4) Product mockups & commercial photography

### Objective
Generate an e-commerce/product photography shot by specifying lighting setup, surface, camera angle, realism, and focus detail.

### Prompt
```text
Using the provided image of the product as the exact reference (keep the same
product identity and proportions), create a high-resolution, studio-lit
product photograph of a minimalist ceramic coffee mug in matte black,
presented on a polished concrete surface. The lighting is a three-point
softbox setup designed to create soft, diffused highlights and eliminate
harsh shadows. The camera angle is a slightly elevated 45-degree shot to
showcase its clean lines. Ultra-realistic, with sharp focus on the steam
rising from the coffee. Square image.
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image.
- **Key controls**
  - Product description: minimalist matte-black mug.
  - Scene: polished concrete.
  - Lighting: explicit *three-point softbox*.
  - Camera: *45-degree* elevated angle.

## 5) Minimalist & negative space design

### Objective
Produce a minimal composition with lots of empty space suitable for overlay text.

### Prompt
```text
Using the provided image of the maple leaf as the subject reference, create a
minimalist composition featuring a single, delicate red maple leaf positioned
in the bottom-right of the frame. The background is a vast, empty off-white
canvas, creating significant negative space for text. Soft, diffused lighting
from the top left. Square image.
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image.
- **Key controls**
  - Layout: explicit subject placement (*bottom-right*).
  - Negative space: *vast, empty off-white canvas*.
  - Lighting direction: top-left.
  - Output constraint: square.

### Objective
Transform a character image into a multi-panel comic with a specified art style.

### Prompt
```text
Using the provided character image as the reference, make a 3 panel comic in
a gritty, noir art style with high-contrast black and white inks. Put the
character in a humorous scene.
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image (character reference).
- **Key controls**
  - Output structure: *3 panel comic*.
  - Style constraints: gritty noir, high contrast inks.
  - Narrative constraint: humorous scene.
- **Expected output**
  - A 3-panel sequential layout while keeping the character recognizable.

---

## 7) Grounding with Google Search

### Objective
Generate an image based on recent/real-time info by allowing the model to use Google Search.

### Prompt
```text
Using the provided image as a base canvas / visual reference, make a simple
but stylish graphic of last night's Arsenal game in the Champion's League
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image (paired with a tool-enabled request in code).
- **Key controls**
  - The important part is not the wording alone; it’s the **tooling config** (`google_search`) combined with the prompt.
- **Expected output**
  - A graphic reflecting real-world context (scores/teams) grounded via search.

## 9) Inpainting (semantic masking)

### Objective
Change only one specific element in the image while preserving everything else.

### Prompt
```text
"Using the provided image of a living room, change only the blue sofa to be
a vintage, brown leather chesterfield sofa. Keep the rest of the room,
including the pillows on the sofa and the lighting, unchanged."
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image.
- **Key controls**
  - “Change only X” is the core constraint.
  - Explicit preservation list (pillows, lighting) reduces collateral edits.
- **Expected output**
  - Localized edit with consistent scene geometry and lighting.

## 10) Style transfer

### Objective
Re-render an image into a new artistic style while preserving composition.

### Prompt
```text
"Transform the provided photograph of a modern city street at night into the artistic style of Vincent van Gogh's 'Starry Night'. Preserve the original composition of buildings and cars, but render all elements with swirling, impasto brushstrokes and a dramatic palette of deep blues and bright yellows."
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + image.
- **Key controls**
  - Explicitly preserve composition.
  - Explicitly describe stylistic tokens (swirling impasto, palette).
- **Expected output**
  - Same layout, new brushstroke/texture/color logic.

---

## 11) Advanced composition (combining multiple images)

### Objective
Compose a new scene by combining key elements from two provided images.

### Prompt
```text
"Create a professional e-commerce fashion photo. Take the blue floral dress
from the first image and let the woman from the second image wear it.
Generate a realistic, full-body shot of the woman wearing the dress, with
the lighting and shadows adjusted to match the outdoor environment."
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**

## 12) High-fidelity detail preservation

### Objective
Apply a change but preserve identity-critical details (face, logo edges, etc.).

### Prompt
```text
"Take the first image of the woman with brown hair, blue eyes, and a neutral
expression. Add the logo from the second image onto her black t-shirt.
Ensure the woman's face and features remain completely unchanged. The logo
should look like it's naturally printed on the fabric, following the folds
of the shirt."
```

### How the prompt works
- **Inputs**
  - Text + multiple images.
- **Key controls**
  - Identity lock: explicit facial features must remain unchanged.
  - Physical integration: logo must follow fabric folds.
- **Expected output**
  - Preserved face + realistic logo placement.
